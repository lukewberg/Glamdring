## A JavaScript and Typescript transpiler and bundler.

Currently a work in progress.
This is an exercise in learning Rust and expanding my knowledge of CS fundamentals. Hence, the use of AI programming tools and code generation has been prohibited. The **only** use of AI by myself is for the purpose of conducting research and answering questions about compilers and their components.
