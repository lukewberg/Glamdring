# Glamdring

## A JavaScript and Typescript transpiler and bundler.

Currently a work in progress.
This is an exercise in learning Rust and expanding my knowledge of CS fundamentals. Hence, the use of AI programming tools and code generation has been prohibited. The **only** use of AI by myself is for the purpose of conducting research and answering questions about compilers and their components.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Lexer (current WIP)
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] AST
- [ ] Transpiler
- [ ] Bundler
- [ ] CLI
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Documentation

### Anatomy and methodology

- The lexer is a hand-written lexer that uses a state machine to tokenize the input.
- The parser is a recursive descent parser that uses a predictive parsing table to parse the tokens.
- The AST is a tree structure that is generated by the parser.
### Resources used

- The Rust Programming Language (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Crafting Interpreters (https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
